antifraud.py under src directory contains the python code for solving the challenge below. No additional libraries, environments or dependencies were used.

With input data of 3 million records, the program takes a total of ~180 seconds to execute.

Download the input files (.txt) from the given link in the paymo_input folder.

The program is designed to skip the streaming records which have insufficient data or data in inconsistent format.

##Challenge Summary

Imagine you're a data engineer at a "digital wallet" company called PayMo that allows users to easily request and make payments to other PayMo users. The team at PayMo has decided they want to implement features to prevent fraudulent payment requests from untrusted users. 

###Feature 1
When anyone makes a payment to another user, they'll be notified if they've never made a transaction with that user before.

* "unverified: You've never had a transaction with this user before. Are you sure you would like to proceed with this payment?"

###Feature 2
The PayMo team is concerned that these warnings could be annoying because there are many users who haven't had transactions, but are still in similar social networks. 

For example, User A has never had a transaction with User B, but both User A and User B have made transactions with User C, so User B is considered a "friend of a friend" for User A.

For this reason, User A and User B should be able to pay each other without triggering a warning notification since they're "2nd degree" friends.

To account for this, PayMo would like you to also implement this feature. When users make a payment, they'll be notified when the other user is outside of their "2nd-degree network".

* "unverified: This user is not a friend or a "friend of a friend". Are you sure you would like to proceed with this payment?"


###Feature 3
More generally, PayMo would like to extend this feature to larger social networks. Implement a feature to warn users only when they're outside the "4th degree friends network".

<img src="./images/fourth-degree-friends2.png" width="600">

In the above diagram, payments have transpired between User

* A and B 
* B and C 
* C and D 
* D and E 
* E and F

Under this feature, if User A were to pay User E, there would be no warning since they are "4th degree friends". 

However, if User A were to pay User F, a warning would be triggered as their transaction is outside of the "4th-degree friends network."

(Note that if User A were to pay User C instead, there would be no warning as they are "2nd-degree" friends and within the "4th degree network") 


##Details of implementation

[Back to Table of Contents] (README.md#table-of-contents)

###Input

Ideally, payment data would come from a real-time, streaming API, but we don't want this challenge to focus on the relatively uninteresting "DevOps" of connecting to an API.

As a result, you may assume that collecting the payments has been done for you and the data resides in two comma-delimited files in the `paymo_input` directory. 

The first file, `batch_payment.txt`, contains past data that can be used to track users who have previously paid one another. These transactions should be used to build the initial state of the entire user network.

Data in the second file, `stream_payment.txt` should be used to determine whether there's a possibility of fraud and a warning should be triggered.

You should assume that each new line of `stream_payment.txt` corresponds to a new, valid PayMo payment record -- regardless of being 'unverified' -- and design your program to handle a text file with a large number of payments. 

###Output

Your code should process each line in `stream_payment.txt` and for each payment, output a line containing one of two words, `trusted` or `unverified`. 

`trusted` means the two users involved in the transaction have previously paid one another (when implementing Feature 1) or are part of the "friends network" (when implementing Feature 2 and 3).

`unverified` means the two users have not previously been involved in a transaction (when implementing Feature 1) or are outside of the "friends network" (when implementing Features 2 and 3)

The output should be written to a text file in the `paymo_output` directory. Because we are asking you to implement a minimum of three features, your program should output to at least three text files in the `paymo_output` directory. 

Each output file should be named after the applicable feature you implemented (i.e., `output1.txt`, `output2.txt` and `output3.txt`)

For example, if there were 5 lines of transactions in the `stream_payment.txt`, then the following `output1.txt` file for Feature 1 could look like this: 

	trusted
	trusted
	unverified
	unverified
	trusted


##Description of Data

[Back to Table of Contents] (README.md#table-of-contents)

The `batch_payment.txt` and `stream_payment.txt` input files are formatted the same way.

As you would expect of comma-separated-value files, the first line is the header. It contains the names of all of the fields in the payment record. In this case, the fields are 

* `time`: Timestamp for the payment 
* `id1`: ID of the user making the payment 
* `id2`: ID of the user receiving the payment 
* `amount`: Amount of the payment 
* `message`: Any message the payer wants to associate with the transaction

Following the header, assume each new line contains a single new PayMo payment record with each field delimited by a comma. In some cases, the field can contain Unicode as PayMo users are fond of placing emojis in their messages. For simplicity's sake, you can choose to ignore those emojis.

For example, the first 10 lines (including the header) of `batch_payment.txt` or `stream_payment.txt` could look like: 

	time, id1, id2, amount, message
	2016-11-02 09:49:29, 52575, 1120, 25.32, Spam

##Testing your directory structure and output format
[Back to Table of Contents] (README.md#table-of-contents)

From the `insight_testsuite` folder, you can run the test with the following command:

	insight_testsuite$ ./run_tests.sh 

The output of `run_tests.sh` should look like:

    [PASS]: test-2-paymo-trans (output1.txt)
    [FAIL]: test-2-paymo-trans (output2.txt)
    1c1
    < trusted
    ---
    > unverified
    [PASS]: test-2-paymo-trans (output3.txt
    [Fri Nov  4 13:20:25 PDT 2016] 2 of 3 tests passed

on failed tests and	
	
	[PASS]: test-1-paymo-trans (output1.txt)
	[PASS]: test-1-paymo-trans (output2.txt)
	[PASS]: test-1-paymo-trans (output3.txt)
	[Fri Nov  4 13:20:25 PDT 2016] 3 of 3 tests passed
on success.

One test has been provided as a way to check formatting. `run_tests.sh` should alert you if the directory structure is incorrect.
